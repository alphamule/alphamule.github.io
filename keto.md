# where to get keto fuel

What I do is buy 3 bags at a time as a subscription. That way I get the sub discount and no shipping. Then it comes out to $40 a bag. Each bag has 10,000 calories which is like 5 days worth at the start, but later you’ll probably eat less (if everything goes to plan). 

Then I cancel the subscription until next time I want to order. No penalty.  Sometimes you have to email them when you want the next one so that they send it immediately rather than waiting for your month anniversary.  They don't seem to mind. 

Chocolate is good.  Vanilla is OK. Cinnamon is vile. Plain is somewhat nice because then I add in a squeeze of crystal light or mio water enhancer for a fruity flavor.

# how to make keto fuel

You have to add your own oil. My favorite is the lightest, least flavorful olive oil I can find. 

You add four scoops of the powder to 1/2 cup of oil into a 2L pitcher filled the rest of the way with water.  You'll want to mix it and what I found works best is an immersion blender with a whisk attachment.  Then I pour it into a couple nalgenes and leave it in the fridge.  It has even better consistency after it's sat for a couple hours or overnight (I also use chilled water when I make it so it's colder right after I mix it).  Lasts 2, maybe 3 days.  When I get going I dilute it further to lower my calorie count and trick my brain (I use two 1400 ml nalgenes instead of two 1L ones).

# how to know if you're in keto

I started with keto sticks, which are useful at the beginning.  They’re cheap and help you know at the beginning whether you’re doing keto correctly. The down side is that after a month or so, your body adjusts and doesn’t spill ketones into your urine any more, so they stop working. 

If you have a dual use blood glucose meter, you can use that forever, but the test strips are expensive ($45 for 30 days worth).  I find this very useful, though, as I'm going through the end game now and it's been getting progressively harder to lose weight.

The glucose # gives me an idea of how hungry I am going to be this day.  I think this is because hunger is a function of the negative first derivative of glucose re time, meaning if it's high, it has a long way to drop and the dropping is what makes you hungry.  On days where mine is at the high range, I know I'm going to have to dedicate more will power to not eating.  The ketone value I think is a measure of how much fat you are burning. I find a strong correlation between that number and how much weight I will lose that day.  This number goes right to zero when you eat pretty any amount of carb, so you can use it to recognize whether you're doing it right or not.

# how to dial in what to eat

I used these blood tests to really dial in what I could eat.  I figured out a base set of food that I knew that would make the numbers go in the right direction, then I would add a single thing and see how it all turned out the next day (I would have done it immediately after if I had test strip $$ to burn).  If the numbers kept improving, then I knew it would be an ok food.  I suspect everyone will be different but some staples of mine in addition to the ketofuel are eggs, cheese sticks, nori, pickles, coconut cream and mushrooms.  Things that seem like they'd be ok, but don't work for me are jerky, quest bars, sugar alcohols and nuts.

To get things going usually I just drink exclusively ketofuel, but as much as I want until my blood numbers look good.  By then I'm not really that hungry ever, so I start to intermittently fast.  I usually only drink coffee until like 2-4.  Then I drink about 100ml of ketofuel per hour or whenever I'm hungry with a couple ok snacks if I am still hungry.  My goal is to keep myself below 1200 calories a day

I used this technique again to discover the truth behind a lot of foods that are marketed as 'keto-friendly'.  At one point, I was trying to engineer my own soylent and made it out of just protein and fiber.  But, my blood glucose would stay high even though this was pretty much all I was eating for a couple days.  Turns out that the distinction between soluble and insoluble fiber is important and under-reported.  The fiber I was taking, which was basically metamucil, was 100% soluble fiber.  These are basically carbs-lite.  Taking that out of my diet immediately corrected the numbers and fixed my hunger back to how it was before.

Lots of foods use this soluble/insoluble trick to hide what they put in there udner the rubric of 'dietary fiber'.  If it doesn't explicitly say 'insoluble', I assume it's the carb-lite somewhat bad kind.  They do this with all sorts of keto snack bars and candies, too.  Or they use sugar alcohols.  Some are said not to affect blood sugar (xylitol, erythritol, stevia), while others like malitol are similar to soluble fiber and are carbs-lite.  Stover's candies, for example say 'made with stevia' prominently on the label, but stevia is way down on the ingredients list while malitol is up at the top.   Basically none of these are good for you.  The kinds of sugar alcohols and fiber that taste good are carby and the ones that are carb free taste kinda bad so you couldn't really pack enough together to make a bar or a candy, so I just avoid them all together.

Another thing I learned from that pure protein/fiber mix was that you can have too much protein.  Some people say that you need 1g protein per 1lb body weight, so I tried eating 150g.  Eating this, I could not get my glucose number to go below 90.  I suspect my body was undergoing gluconeogenesis, where excess protein is converted to glucose.  When I dialed this back to 100g, both my glucose and ketone levels started moving in the right directions. 

After these experiments, I just went back to eating the regular ketofuel recipe, as this was way easier and seemed to work better anyways.


# how really this is a psychological problem, not nutritional or physiological

But, critically, I think of this stuff as a physiological tool to correct for a psychological problem.  I've seen people try to do keto, but who haven't seen nearly the success that I have.  I suspect that they would do way better if they spent half the time they used on figuring out new kinds of keto food they can eat instead on figuring out how to eat less keto food in the first place.  The food is only magic insofar as it makes you less hungry.  If, out of habit, you eat the same amount of keto food, you'll probably be worse off than if you hadn't done any of this at all.  Bacon is in no way good for you.  But, on the other hand, you could lose weight on twinkies, if you could limit yourself to just 8 per day.

I think going into keto helped solve the problem of that really ravenous, can't ignore it, gotta have food right now sort of irrational moments.  Then, hunger became this kind of low throbbing, but ultimately manageable sensation.

# other stuff that might have helped on the psychological front

I started using headspace daily during this time which I think really helped as they have 30day courses specifically about hunger and craving.  I also walked 4 miles daily and did a light workout every day.  Like I mentioned, I kept a very visible log of doing all this stuff in a place I saw it constantly.  I had a digital scale.  I think this was pretty critical so I could see that it was actually working and also to reassure myself when I slipped back that I hadn't really slipped that much at all.

# mantras to overcome hunger

I credit a lot of my success to thinking back to a couple of ideas or mantras to help me overcome hunger:

* the average american could go one month without eating, nourished only by their fat stores (and maybe a multi vitamin), and suffer basically no ill effect
* hunger is the sensation of your body losing weight
* every molecule of your being entered through your mouth as food or drink at one point.  an overwhelming majority of the molecules you lose will exit through your mouth and nose through exhalation.
* once you get going, you can graph out your weight loss and know that logically your trend line and your goal line will intersect.  This will happen at a specific day in the future, or specific hour even.  Everything you eat pushes that y-intercept back by some finite amount of time, maybe a few hours or maybe days
* the way that food is structured in our society seems suspiciously like a conspiracy.  If you were a food manufacturer and you discovered something that is super cheap and would make people eat 25% more, you would just pour that all over everything.
* I don't think starvation mode exists, or at least it's not the bugaboo people make it out to be.  People talk about how everyone gains the weight back.  Well, if you think about this as a diet and you'll eventually go back to what you were eating before, is it any surprise that, in the long run, you get right back to where you were?
